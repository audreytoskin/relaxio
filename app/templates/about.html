<div id="aboutpage"><h2>About</h2>
	
	<p>Relaxio is designed to allow users to create and store their own ambient mixes for reading, relaxing, and focusing. This app was developed as my capstone project in the <a href="https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp">Front-end Web Development course</a> at <a href="bloc.io">Bloc.io.</a></p> 

	<p>All sound mp3s came from YouTube audio. Singing bowls mp3 available courtesy of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/33bowls">33bowls monastery.</a></p>
	
	<p>Significant contributions to  development were made by Matthew Maxwell, my Bloc mentor. Logo and icons designed by Gisele Schaaf.</p>
