	<p>Relaxio is designed to allow users to create and store their own ambient mixes for reading, relaxing, and focusing. It is  inspired by and dedicated to the entire <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr">ASMR community.</a></p>
	<p>This app was developed as my capstone project in the <a href="https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp">Front-end Web Development course</a> at <a href="bloc.io">Bloc.io.</a> Significant contributions to the development work were made by Matthew Maxwell, my Bloc mentor. The app logo, sound, and play/pause icons were all designed by Gisele Schaaf.</p>
