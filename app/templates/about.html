	<p>Relaxio is designed to allow users to create and store their own ambient mixes for reading, relaxing, and focusing. This app was developed as my capstone project in the Front-end Web Development course at <a href="http://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc.io.</a></p> 

	<p>All sound mp3s sourced via YouTube. Singing bowls mp3 available courtesy of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/33bowls" target="_blank">33bowls monastery.</a> If you'd like to suggest new sounds that would improve your listening experience, please feel free to reach out via the contact info below.</p>
	
	<p>Significant contributions to  development were made by Matthew Maxwell, my Bloc mentor. Logo and icons designed by Gisele Schaaf.</p>
