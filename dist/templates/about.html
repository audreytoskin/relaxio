	<p>Relaxio is designed to allow users to create and store their own ambient mixes for reading, relaxing, and focusing. This app was developed as my capstone project in the <a href="https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp">Front-end Web Development course</a> at <a href="bloc.io">Bloc.io.</a></p> 

	<p>Significant contributions to  development were made by Matthew Maxwell, my Bloc mentor. The Relaxio logo, sound icons, and play/pause/save icons were  designed by Gisele Schaaf.</p>
