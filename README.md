# RelaxIO

Relaxio is designed to allow users to create and store their own ambient mixes for reading, relaxing, and focusing. This app was developed as my capstone project in the [Front-end Web Development course](Front-end Web Development course) at [Bloc.io](http://localhost:8000/bloc.io). It was built using Javascript, Jquery, Angular, Firebase, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and of course Git/Github.

All sound mp3s sourced via YouTube. Singing bowls mp3 available courtesy of the [33bowls monastery](https://soundcloud.com/33bowls).

Significant contributions to development were made by Matthew Maxwell, my Bloc mentor. Logo and icons designed by Gisele Schaaf.
